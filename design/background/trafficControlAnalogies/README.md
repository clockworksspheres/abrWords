# Traffic Control Analogies

Early on in treatment, as we were trying to describe and nail down the issues I am having, we decided that trying to use ["associations"](design/background/associations/README.md) - was a great way to try to help narrow down what is going on, since one of the major problems is accurately defining what's going on.

Between concussion and speech therapy appointments, it occured to me that I had a problem similar to the old fleet vehicle "govenor" - that wouldn't allow a fleet vehicle go over 50 or 55 miles an hour.  When describing how that was relevant to the speech therapist, we came up with a couple more traffic control like "associations", that might help understand the issues better.

Since then, there have been other issues found - that hinder me from being productive, that I've tried to communicate the issue(s)/problems/roadblocks keeping me from doing what I used to be able to do.

Here is a working list of analogies we're already working on - or wishing to get help/validation/feedback from my medical treatment team:

* [[The Govenor]]
	* ![[Speed]]
	* ![[Accelleration]]
	* ![[Velocity]]

	* ![[Community]]
	* ![[Learning]]
	* ![[Reflecting]]
	* ![[What Will I Do If]]
