# Traffic Control Analogies

Early on in treatment, as we were trying to describe and nail down the issues I am having, we decided that trying to use ["associations"](design/background/associations/README.md) - was a great way to try to help narrow down what is going on, since one of the major problems is accurately defining what's going on.

Between concussion and speech therapy appointments, it occured to me that I had a problem similar to the old fleet vehicle "govenor" - that wouldn't allow a fleet vehicle go over 50 or 55 miles an hour.  When describing how that was relevant to the speech therapist, we came up with a couple more traffic control like "associations", that might help understand the issues better.

We are hoping that better understanding the issues will help us focus on therapies that can get a brain - hopefully mine too - back into servicable, working order, avoiding any "brain crash".
