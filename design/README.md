## What is abr?

'abr' stands for [Aphasia](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/aphasia) [Brain]() Repair - or that's the goal, to help fix aphasia related issues generated by multiple health problems, that in the end caused multiple concussions over time, as well as what I believe to have been a mini-stroke.

We are hoping that better understanding the issues will help us focus on therapies that can get a brain - hopefully mine too - back into servicable, working order, avoiding any "brain crash".

One goal of the project is to help build, rebuild and/or repair the thought-language, language-speech, and language-writing bridges in the brain.  


## Project Background

After a couple of concussions, and a mini-stroke, and many physical, concussion and speech therapy sessions, word searches were added to my treatment plan.

In parallel, my sister and I agreed to a trade, I would teach my nephew Marko some coding, in trade for my sister giving me piano lessons.  Since the start of some new medications, mid-summer 2022, it has started to be a little easier to move my fingers.  The hope is that piano practise will help re-train, and regain some fine motor control, as well as in brain related injury repair.

The plan is to teach Marko some very basic use of [Magicgui](), to create a little app to My plan for teaching basic GUI construction, to create a task and time tracking app, and/or possibly a catalogging app that could keep track of books, music, movies, or a specific collection of items.  In the process, I hope to give him a survey introduction to computer science, in a simaler yet simpler way as I did when I taught CS101 several years ago at a two year branch of a state college in New Mexico.  At the time, that course was based on the book: []().

Another goal is to use the creation and building of this app to teach Marko examples of programming techniques, python, magicgui, computer science principles, etc., enough that he should have no problem building his app, with little direction.  The CS101 course I taught was part lecture and part lab, and to start at lease, we'll follow that same model - me working on this project as an example of things he needs to do and/or could do to create his application project.  

Notes, lesson plans, resources, etc., for the teaching part of this project will be kept in the design/lesson-plans folder of this repository.
